# HTML & CSS Learning Examples

A small collection of simple HTML and CSS example files intended for learning and experimenting with basic web layout, lists, tables, media, and CSS styling.

Author: bars-zholdoshov

## What's in this repository

- `containers.html` — examples showing container elements and layout techniques.
- `lists.html` — examples of ordered, unordered, and nested lists.
- `tables.html` — basic table examples for tabular data and table markup.
- `video_and_audio` — a file demonstrating embedding video/audio elements (open in a browser to view).
- `structing_web_pages.html` — structural HTML examples (headings, sections, semantic tags).
- `CSS/` — folder with CSS examples and styles:
  - `CSS/css_exercise.html` — a small exercise page demonstrating CSS usage.
  - `CSS/styles.css` — stylesheet used by the exercise page.

## How to use

These are static HTML files. You can view them directly by opening the files with a browser (double-click or "Open with"). For a slightly better development flow, run a small local HTTP server and browse via http://localhost.

On Windows (PowerShell), using Python 3 installed on your PATH:

```powershell
# start a local server in the project root
python -m http.server 8000

# then open the project in your default browser
start http://localhost:8000
```

Or simply open any of the `.html` files in the `D:/projects/HTML_CSS_learning` folder with your browser.

## Notes and learning goals

- Practice basic HTML structure and semantic tags.
- Practice lists, tables, and embedding media (audio/video).
- Practice external CSS usage and simple selectors in `CSS/styles.css`.
